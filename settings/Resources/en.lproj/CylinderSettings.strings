    FOOTER_TEXT = "HOW TO CODE YOUR OWN EFFECTS:

Open iFile (or Filza) and go to /Library/Cylinder. There you'll see a bunch of folders with people's usernames. In these folders you'll see a bunch of .lua files. If you open any of these with the text viewer you can see the code. For a start I'd recommend looking at the Backwards.lua file in the gertab folder to get an idea of how to do it. In there if you edit the 2*offset to 3*offset (don't forget to reload the effect after) you'll notice a kind of \"Backwards hella far\" effect.

Follow the pattern you see in order to add your own effects. If you get stuck, take a look at EXAMPLE.lua or search \"lua tutorial\" on YouTube.";
