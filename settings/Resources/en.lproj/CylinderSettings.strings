    FOOTER_TEXT = "HOW TO CODE YOUR OWN EFFECTS:

Click Source Code and you will be taken to this project's Github page. Go to /tweak/CylinderAnimator.swift where you will see the code for all the effects. You can add your own static method to the CylinderAnimator class and the go to -addEffectsFromDirectory: in settings/CLEffectsController.m and add your own CLEffect object to the effects array filling out its name, selector, and your name

Follow the pattern you see in order to add your own effects. If you get stuck, take a look at the examples or search \"Swift tutorial\" on YouTube.";
